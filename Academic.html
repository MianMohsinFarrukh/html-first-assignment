    <p>The Division of Education holds a prominent place in the University. The Division is responsible for the
        development of new academic programs in teacher education that are subsequently offered at all the University
        Campuses and the affiliated colleges. The Division has developed various programs including MEd, MA Education,
        MA Education Leadership and Management, MPhil Education, MPhil Educational Leadership and Policy Studies and PhD
        Education. Division has also developed a 4-year BEd (Hons) program that is expected to attract better graduates
        as entrants into pre-service teacher education. It also hoped that this longer and rigorous teacher education
        program will enhance the status of the teachers in the society. Research on contemporary issues faced by the
        education sector in Pakistan has also been a focus of the faculty at the Division of Education. The faculty has
        continuously been adding to the existing knowledge by publishing both at the national and international levels.
        The faculty also presents their research findings globally.</p>
