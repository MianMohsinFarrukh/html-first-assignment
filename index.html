    holding workshops, seminars, short and advanced courses. Postgraduate Diploma and Teaching Certificate for faculty
    needs a special mention. This program focuses on capacity development of the faculty in response to the emerging
    needs of the time. Foreign scholarships are also awarded to attract the best available talent for faculty.</p>

  <p>For harmonious and all round growth and development of students personalities and character building, sports and
    other co-curricular activities such as debates, speeches, dramas, art exhibitions and other healthy activities are
    organized regularly. Students are motivated to learn the art of peaceful co-existence and finding solutions to the
    problems through dialogues and discussions. Due to such initiatives significant changes could be observed in the
    outlook and behavior of the students. It is due to these earnest efforts,<small style="color: rgb(153, 126, 77);"> meticulous diligence and untiring strife
    that UE graduates are fitting in well at home and abroad in the system as well as in the employment market which
    indeed is a matter of pride for UE.</small></p>
